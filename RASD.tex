\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

Today, as the demand for the professional role of programmer is constantly increasing, so is the demand for applications that allow trained programmers as well as hobbyists to grow and hone their skills. Because of this need, \textit{CodeKataBattle} accommodates a growing trend in software development education, where hands-on experience and teamwork play an important role in preparing students for real-world challenges.

The platform operates as a bridge between educators and students, allowing educators to test students from all over the world.
The scope of these challenges is train future programmers using a test-first approach, and in particular training them with peers using 
code kata, which are small programming exercises for which test cases are already provided; in this way, the students can develop succesful routines to solve problems in a specific language without having to worry abbout testing.\newline
\textit{CodeKataBattle} encourages iterative development processes,teaching the importance of continuous improvement to meet all the requests the educator makes.
Instead of more traditional methods, like lectures or online courses, \textit{CodeKataBattle} aims to provide a modern learning experience; in this way students not only reinforce their coding skills but also improve critical aspects such as teamwork, time management, and communication, fundamental skills in many workplaces and vital for success in the dynamic field of software development.

The platform provides users with a user-friendly interface; in particular, the educators can create and manage code kata battles within specific tournaments, that students can participate in, alone or in teams. Educators can upload code katas, set submission deadlines, configure scoring parameters, and give permissions to colleagues to create other battles. 
Also, they can reward the students with badges, defining specific rules to achieve them, adding a competitive gamification element to the experience.
The team score is update every time a team's member push a new commits to their \textit{GitHub} repository (that is created automatically at the beginning of every battle). In this way, both students and educators can monitor the progress of all the teams during the battle.
The tournament rank, that provide insights into individual performance of all the students involved in the tournament, is generated by \textit{CodeKataBattle} summing the battle scores obtained from every battle the student participated in.

\paragraph{The goals of the application are the following:}
\begin{enumerate} [label=G\arabic*:, align=left, leftmargin=*]
    \item Allow students to partecipate in coding tournaments and battles.
    \item Allow students to deliver their solution to the platform.
    \item Allow educators to evaluate team's solution.
    \item Allow students and educators to monitor teams rank during a battle.
    \item Allow students and educatros to monitor tournament score of each student. 
    \item Allow educators to create and manage tournaments and battles.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Scope}

In this section, we analyse the world phenomena and the shared phenomena, according to the "World and the Machine" paradigm introduced by M.Jackson and P.Zave. In this context, the Machine is identified with the application to be developed and the world as the real-world environment in which it will be used.

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product perspective}
In the first part of this section, we will analyse some scenarios involving the usage of CKB.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Registration on CKB:} 
    Jamie, a computer science student, decides to check out the CodeKataBattle application under the
    recommendation of one of his professors, to improve his programming skills for one of his university courses.
    Through his laptop, he opens the CKB homepage and after reading the description on the CKB website, decides to sign up to the platform.
    He cicks on the "sign up" button on the homepage and he is redirected to the sign up form, through which he inserts all required personal data,
    like name, surname, email, a username and password. After linking his GitHub profile, he successfully created an account on the CKB platform.
    
    \item \textbf{Educator Creates a New Tournament:} John, a computer science professor, logs into the CKB application because he has decided to create
     a challenging code kata tournament for the students of his class as part of the final mark for his course. He clicks on "Create new tournament"
      banner, enters the required data and customizes all aspects of the tournaments according to his needs, like the tournament description and subscription deadlines. Lastly,
       John decide to give permission to other collegues to create new battles for the partecipants.

    \item \textbf{Educator Creates a New Battle:} Sarah, a computer science professor, decides to create a new battle for one of the tournaments she manages.
    To do so, she opens the CKB appliation, chooses one of the tournaments and clicks on the "create a battle" button. Because of the wide range of customization the application offers, she is able to organize and set the 
    battle in the best possible way to accomodate her students' learning needs. After customizing the battle description and deadlines, she uploads the Code Kata including its test cases and build automation scripts. Then,
    she is able to customize the parameters used for evaluation and computation of the final score. Other than configuring the standard timeliness and functionality parameters, Sarah is also able to choose which aspects will be 
    analyzed for the evaluation of the quality parameter, and which weight they will have on the final score automatically computed by the system.

    \item \textbf{Student Joins a Code Kata Battle:} Kelly logs into the CKB application after receiving a notification
     for the creation of a new battle in the tournamet in which she is involved. After reading the battle description and all related details,
      Kelly decides to form a team to participate in this battle. In the team creation section, Kelly selects the number of teammates she want
       for the team (ensuring that respect the minimum and maximum value for the battle) and sends an invitation
        to some of her friends, waiting for thir response. In the meantime, she also receives a request by another user to join her team , which she decides to decline.
        After her team is complete, her team officially joins the battle.

    \item \textbf{Student Submits Code Solution:} Jordan, a prticipant of a Code Kata battle, after finishing writing and modifying the code for his project locally on his IDE of choice,
    decides to push his work on the team's GitHub repository, eager to know the result. This action triggers an automated 
    analysis of the code (considering factors such as functionality, timeliness, and code quality as set by the educator which created the battle). 
    After the analisys is finished, the team's score is dynamically updated and dispayed on the rank of the battle on the platform.

    \item \textbf{User Visualizes Real-Time Battle Rank:} Taylor logs into the CKB application to visualize the position
     of her team in the battle they are involved. She navigates to the real-time battle rank section and
      the rank with all the teams's scores appears, providing a clear rappresentation of the situation
       of the team in the battle and allowing her to plan how to manage their work accordingly. 
       Scrolling the leaderbord she finds out that they are in the middle of the list, so they need to put 
       much more effort in the competition to obtain a good score.

    \item \textbf{User Receives Final Battle Rank Notification:} Mark is impatient to know the final 
    result of the battle he has participated in the past weeks. Some days after the battle concludes, Mark receives
     a notification from CKB application. Navigating in the website, on the tab of the tournament, Mark visualize the 
     final rank, understanding the level of his coding skills and that he still has a lot to improve to 
     reach the top.

    \item \textbf{Student Accumulates Tournament Scores:} Pat logs into CKB to visualize his personal score in
     the tournament he is involved. Pat navigates to the tournament scores section, visualizing his and other 
     partecipants scores; in this way, Pat can see clearly his situation in the tournament and have a a clear view  
     of all the other partecipants.

    \item \textbf{Educator creates a badge:} Morgan, an educator using CKB to challenge their students, decides to 
    make the challenge more fun and competitive through the gamification feature offered by the platform. During the tournament
    creation phase, Morgan decides to create some badges associated to the tournament, which will be assigned to students who fullfill their requirements. 
    In particular, he decides to create a new badge named "Unity is strength" to reward the collaboration between students.
    In the badge creation window within the tournament creation, he sets the name of the badge and the rule to achieve it:
    $ {team\_memebers} > 3 $
, selecting \textit{team\_members} in the list of available attributes to create rules for badges. 
    In this way all the students that partecipate in a battle with a team of four or more members receive this badge.
\end{itemize}
After the presentation of the above scenarios, we can formalize a \textbf{UML class diagram} for our system. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/UML_231221.png}
    \caption{CKB Platform UML Class Diagram}
    \label{fig:CKB_uml1}
    \centering
\end{figure}

Here are some notes regarding the most important entities of the diagram.
\begin{itemize}

    \item The \emph{User} abstract class is specialized into \emph{Student} and \emph{Educator}. Educators are the users who can create new Tournaments and Battles, while Students can partitipate to a Tournament, compete in Battles and receive Badges.
    
    \item The educator creates a Tournament by instantiating a \emph{Tournament} class. This class is composed of different \emph{Battle} classes, each one representing a battle created by an educator. The \emph{Battle} class itself is composed of a \emph{CodeKata} class containing the actual code of the battle, a \emph{TeamHandler} class which is responsible for handling the creation of teams that will participate to the battle, and an \emph{EvaluationSystem} class, used to compute the score of each team for the current battle. 
    
    \item Each students subscribed to a Tournament has a \emph{StudentStats} class associated to. This class contains 
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item the tournament score for the corresponding student
        \item the \emph{availableStats} list, containing all the statistics provided by the CKB platform, tailored for the current turnament. This list will be used to gather the necessary variables in order to assign Badges to each student.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Whenever a student subscribed to a tournament wants to join a battle, he queries the \emph{Tournament} class, which contains the list of available battles. In order to take part to the battle, the student has to either create a team or join an existing one. The \emph{Tournament} class adds the student to the \emph{TeamHandler} class associated with the battle picked by the student. \emph{TeamHandler} contains a list of students that can be invited (which is a list of all students registered for the tournament, excluding students who are part of a complete team for the current battle) and a list of the incomplete teams. Note that a student part of an incomplete team can still be invited to or join another team. Whenever a team contained in \emph{TeamHandler.incompleteTeams} is completed, it is moved to \emph{Battle.teams} and its members are removed from \emph{TeamHandler.eligibleStudents}. Students part of complete teams cannot switch to another team anymore.
    
    \item A tournament must have at least one battle available. If at the battle registration deadline no team has joined it, the battle is cancelled.

    \item Every time a team participating to a battle commits to the GitHub repository, the code is also submitted to the \emph{EvaluationSystem} class, which compute the automatic score for that specific team by querying the \emph{GitHubRepo} and \emph{codeKata} classes in order to evaluate the functional aspect and also the timeliness (\emph{GitHubRepo.lastCommit} attribute serves this purpose). The quality aspect of the score (security, reliability, mantainability) are evaluated using the \emph{StaticAnalyzer} class, that exploits the API of Static analisys tools such as \href{https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/}{SonarQube} to compute this portion of score. Ultimately, the manual portion of the code can be assigned directly by the \emph{Educator} class. The \emph{Battle} class retrieves the score from each team to compute the real time battle ranking.
    
    \item At the end of the battle, every team component has its own \emph{StudentStats.tournamentScore} updated.

    \item The educator can create new Badges and add them to the current Tournament (the \emph{Tournament} class has an \emph{availableBadges} attribute). The process of creating a badge is handled through the \emph{BadgeFactory} class: starting from a list of statistics provided by the CKB platform, the Educator can compute the required badge variables and the correspondig badge rules. Every \emph{Badge} class has a \emph{BadgeUtils} class associated to, which contains a list of the badge variables and the method to compute them. 
    
    \item The assignment of badges is managed by the \emph{Tournament} class, as it can access the statistics of all students (contained in \emph{StudentStats.availableStats}) and all badge variables (contained in \emph{BadgeUtils.badgeVariables}). For every Badge, the \emph{Tournament} class:
    \begin{itemize}    
        \item retrieve how to compute the badge variables from the \emph{BadgeUtils} class
        \item retrieve the statistics of each student
        \item compute the badge variable for each student
        \item assigns the badge
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\newpage

Now we will analyze the behaviour of some object from the UML class diagram. In particular, we will use \textbf{state diagrams} to display the changes the object is subjected to over time.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The state diagram below shows the behaviour of the \emph{User} object through the entire charging process. Please note that an user can decide to subscribe to CKB either as \emph{Educator} or as \emph{Student}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/statechart_userRegistration.png}
    \caption{User registration state diagram}
    \label{fig:CKB_sc1}
    \centering
\end{figure}

The state diagram below shows the process of joining a \emph{Battle}. Please note that a student must be subscribed to the tournament hosting the battle in order to join it. Also, as long as the chosen \emph{Team} is not completed, the student can leave it for another one. Lastly, if the battle subscription deadline expires and the Student is in an incomplete team it cannot participate to the battle.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/statechart_battleRegistration.png}
    \caption{Battle registration state diagram}
    \label{fig:CKB_sc2}
    \centering
\end{figure}

\newpage

The state diagram below shows the process of updating the \emph{Real Time Battle Score}. The process is triggered every time there is a commit to the Team's repo. When the battle deadline expires, the \emph{Automatic Score} is finally computed and we enter the consolidation phase in which the \emph{Manual Score} is assigned by an educator (if required).

\subsection{Product Functions}
In this section, the main functionalities of CKB are presented and described in-depth.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Creation of a Tournament by an Educator:} CKB must provide already registered educators the possibility to create a personalized tournament in a simple way. 
    On the main menu, they need to press the "create new tournament" tab and, in the newly opened window, they should specify all the 
    fundamental information, such as the tournament name, description, and subscription deadline. Optionally, the system also allows educators to set an icon for the tournament. After customizing all mandatory settings, the tournament creation function should allow 
    educators to choose whether to add collectible badges to the tournament. This function must be optional, as a tournament can be fully functional without badges.
    In case educators want to add badges to the tournment, an appropriate customization window should be provided to the user, in order to allow them to have a comprehensive
    and clear view of all parameters available to create rules.The system should allow the user to to create multiple badges within the same tournament. For each one, the application should
    provide functionalities to set a name, a brief description and an optional icon. Then, an arbitrary number of rules can be added, in the following form:
    \[[system\_parameter] \leq,<,=,>,\geq [value,true,false] \]
    in which true and false are only available for boolean parameters, while value can be a static value set by the educator or a dynamic value generated by CKB, for example \textit{max-tot-commits}. Moreover, the user should be allowed to choose the relationship between rules with \textit{and} and \textit{or}
    logical operators, by writing simple logical expressions using previously defined rules and parenthesis, if needed:
    \begin{center}
        \textit{(rule1 or rule2) and rule3}
    \end{center}
    Rules will be evaluated and checked by a validator included in the badge creation functionality, in order to establish if the logical expression can be actually fulfilled and students can actually
    obtain the badge.
    
    \item \textbf{Manage Tournament:} CKB must allow educators to manage tournaments they have created. Each educator must be provided with
    the list of tournament they have created, and for which they are allowed to exploit all fuctionalities as administrators, and the list of tournaments to which they
    have been invited to collaborate. For created tournaments, educators must be allowed to invite other educators as collaborators, by going in the tournament management section and choosing the
    "invite educator" functionality. The invited educator should be allowed to accept or deny the request.\\ In the tournament management section, educators should also be able to view the current status of the tournament rank and the status of all battles within the tournament.
    Educators that are also creators of a tournament must be allowed to close the tournament whenever they seem fit, as long as there are no active battles in the tournament. This function must not be provided to 
    educators which have been invited to manage a tournament.  

    \item \textbf{Creation of a Battle by an Educator:} CKB must provide already registered educators the possibility to create a new battle 
    within tournaments they manage. By clicking the "create battle" tab, a window opens, and the educator is provided an interface through which they can enter all the 
    necessary descriptive information, such as the name of the battle and a description of the challenge. After setting preliminar informations, the educator is asked to upload the software project (including the test cases and the 
    automatic scripts). The educator should also be allowed to set requirements for the creation of teams, like the minimum and maximum number of members for each group. They also need to set two different deadlines, one 
    for the subscription to the battle by students and the other for the end of the battle.
    Lastly, the aplication should provide all necessary functions to customize the evaluation system for the battle. The automatic evaluation system takes into account three different scoring parameters. Each parameter will have a weight on the final score
    set between 0 and 1, also customizable by the educator, and the final sum of all weights will be 1, as to obtain a total score of maximum 100 points. Available parameters are the following
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Functional.} This parameter measures the number of test cases passed out of all test cases. The maximum number of points that can be obtained through this parameter will be equally distributed among all test cases. 
        As an example, if the functional parameter allows students to score a maximum of 30 points and the project provides 10 test cases, each test case passed will allow
        students to score 3 points. The only customization option provided by this paramter is its weight.
        \item \textit{Timeliness.} This parameter evaluates how much time was spent to complete the project with relation to the registration deadline. After half of the available days are passed, points will be equally 
        distributed among the remaining days available to complete the project and will be progressively subtracted to the total number of obtainable points each time a push is executed in a new day. Educators can choose the starting time from which points will be 
        detracted, other than the weight of this parameter on the total score. 
        \item \textit{Quality}. Quality level of the sources can be evaluated according to multiple parameters, such as security, reliability and mantainability. The educator must be allowed to choose how many parameters to consider as they deem appropriate, to do so the 
        \item application must provide a toggle feature. The application must be connected through appropriate APIs to any third party application, such as \textit{SonarQube}, that is able to provide static analisys of code based on the selected parameters.    
    \end{itemize} 
    Other than the previously described parameters, the educator must indicate whether they want to provide a manual evaluation, whose points will contribute to the final score of the team. This optional evaluation will also have a weight that must
    conform to the previously stated rules.
    
    \item \textbf{Allow a Student to Join a Tournament:} CKB must allow students to browse and choose a tournament to join. To do so, a list of all ongonig tournaments must be available to all students subscribed to the platform, equipped with 
    appropriate search and sort features to allow students to find the best tournament according to their skill level and their interests. On the tournament overview page, a join option must be provided if the tournament is still open for subscriptions.
    
    \item \textbf{Allow a Student to Join a Battle:} CKB must provide the students involved in a tournament with the opportunity to join a battle by different means. 
    Any student that wants to join a battle must create or join an existing team first, according to the rules stated in the battle desciption. For this reason, different features are provided to the student to make the process of joining a battle as flexible as possible.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Create a new team.} Each student is allowed to create their own team for any battle. This feature allows the student to choose a name for the team and the number of members. Within the creation context,
        if the team has more than one member (including the creator), the student can already send invites to other students subscribed to the same tournament by searching their username in a search bar. This feature must also be available after the team creation process is completed: 
        incomplete teams are displayed in the battle overview page until they can join the battle. 
        Any team member can send join invites to other students within the tournament. If the team has only one member and is compliant with battle rules, upon completing the 
        team creation process the team immediately joins the battle.
        \item \textit{Join an existing team}. Upon visualizing the battle overview page, students are provided with the list of teams that have not reached ther maximum number of members yet. Students must be allowed to choose any team among the list,
        to visualize the team detailes, including the maximum number of members and current members, and must be allowed to send a join request to the team they prefer. At the same time, any member of a team that receives a join request is provided with the option to accept or decline a request. 
        Once a team member performs one of those actions, other members cannot override that action.   
        \item \textit{Quit team.} Students who are members of incomplete teams should also be allowed to quit their team. This feature must only be available for teams that have not joined the battle yet.
        If the only team member of a team decides to quit, the team is deleted. 
    \end{itemize}
    Join requests by students and join invites by teams can be acceped or denied. As soon as a team reaches its maximum number of members, it is removed from the list of incomplete teams and joins the battle. At this point all information 
    about the team cannot be edited, and team members cannot quit the team.
    \item \textbf{Allow Users to Check Rankings:} CKB applications provides a ranking system for both tournaments and battles. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The tournament rank is based on the personal score assigned to each student. Each time a student completes a battle and obtains a score, this score is summed to their personal score.
        For this reason, the battle rank is updated each time a battle is officially closed. The tournament overview page must allow both educators and students to check the current tournament rank.
        \item The battle rank is based on the progressive score obtained by each team during a battle. Each time a push is executed ont he GitHub repository of a team, a new evaluation is performed and the team score is updated, thus updating the rank.
        The battle rank must be available in the battle overview page, and both students and educators must be allowed to check it whenever they seem fit. 
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Allow Students to be Notified of Relevant Actions:} CKB must provide a notification system to inform students of relevant actions and events. Multiple scenarios 
    can trigger notifications, which will be displayed in an inbox on the student's account and sent by e-mail, to the address specified during the registration process. The e-mail notification can be optional, users
    should be provided with the function to toggle them on or off. Actions that should trigger notifications are the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Creation of a tournament.} Each time a tournament is created, all students should receive a notification that a new tournament is available.
        \item \textit{Expiration of battle subscription deadline.} When the battle subscription deadline expires, all subscribed students will receive a notification with the link of the GitHub repository for the project.
        \item \textit{A battle is officially closed.} After the final battle rank is computed, all subscribed students will receive a notification informing them that the final rank is available.
        \item \textit{Closing of a tournament.} When an educator decides to close their tournament, all subscribed students will be notified, as the final rank and assigned badges (if provided) are available.
        \item \textit{Join requests or invites.} Whenever educators are invited to join a tournament, students are invited to join a battle or receive a join request for their team, they will be notified.
    \end{itemize}
    Student should also be able to choose for which one of these actions they want to receive real-time notifications, or if they prefer a daily or weekly recap. 
    
\end{itemize}
\subsection{User Characteristics}
In our CKB system, the following type of users are considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unregistred student:} students that are not yet register on CKB. They need to create an account to access the service offered by CKB.
    \item \textbf{Registered student:} students that have an account on CKB. They can use all the functionality offered by CKB for students, for example partecipates at a new tournament.
    \item \textbf{Unregisters educator:} educators that are not yet register on CKB. They need to create an account to access the service offered by CKB.
    \item \textbf{Registerd educator:} educators that have an account on CKB. They can use all the functionality offered by CKB for reducators, for example create a new tournament .
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints}
\textbf{Domain Assumptions:}
\begin{enumerate}[label=D\arabic*:, align=left, leftmargin=*]

\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
The user interface of CKB must satisfy the needs of both educators and students. The main user interface
is a website, that must be available from any type of ”common” device (like personal computers,
tablets and smartphones). In a reasonable way, it is possible to assume that most educators will
use an office dekstop while students might want to use also a mobile phone, so also a mobile-friendly version of the user interface must be be implemented.


\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
CKB is a web-based system. Hence, in order to access it, a generic device, like personal computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, with an internet
connection is needed.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
To work properly, the CKB system relies on some external softwares:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  GitHub provides an API that enables the system to generate new repositories for each team involved in a battle.
    \item  The system integrates with a static analysis tool, that provides an API for incorporating the static analysis of projects, contributing to the automatic score of the team.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
In this section are presented the most relavant use cases for the CKB application.
Each use case is illustrated through the associated sequence diagram, while all uses cases are grouped and presented together in
the use case diagram. Entry conditions and exit conditions are the conditions that must hold for the actor to enter and exit the use case.

As far as performance is concerned, the system must be able to satisfy its users needs at any
time of the day.
In general, we can formulate the following performance-related non-functional requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Nfr1 :] The system must be available 99.9\% of the time in a year.
    \item [Nfr2 :] If the system goes down, it must recover in less than 15 minutes.
    \item [Nfr3 :] The system must be able to link with external services in less than a minute.
    \item [Nfr4 :] The system must be able to fullfill the requests of the educators in less than a minute.
    \item [Nfr5 :] The system must be able to fullfill the requests of the students in less than a minute.
    \item [Nfr6 :] The system must be able to support the simultaneous connection of at least 100.000
users.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design Constraints}

\subsubsection{Standards Compliance}
The application must comply with the standards of security, privacy or other particular directives imposed in the states where it will operate.
The application must be usable on the most popular browsers, therefore it must comply with
the standards of those browsers.
The application must respect the rules of the external APIs it interfaces with.

\subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}
To be used, the application requires that the user’s device has access to the internet.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system must be able to tolerate possible failures that would increase downtime. To do so,
a backup system should be created, that allows the replication of the data contained in the
main server but also of the processes that provide the services of the system. If the system has
a scheduled maintenance, the system must notify the users at least 2 days before. In any case,
even if the system goes down unexpectedly, it must notify the users that it is back up running.

\subsubsection{Availability}
We deem that an availability of 99.99\% for the system is reasonable, which would corresponds to roughly 52 minutes/years of downtime.
To allow such availability the system should have a server running parallel to the main one so,
in case the central server goes down, it can do his stead.

\subsubsection{Security}
The personal informations of the users should be protected.
To do so, encryption is applied to the login credentials of each user, in this way the system
is able to prevent unauthorized accesses to confidential information. The database should be
encrypted at rest and in transit. Encrypt all database connections using protocols such as the
Transport Layer Security protocol, protecting data in transit.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The system should be implemented by using design patterns that allows the code to be reusable
and easily modified in case of future extension or malfunctioning. It should also be implemented
using an object oriented language and by documenting most of the classes and methods, so
that it easy to read and understand for other engineers in case of need.

\subsubsection{Portability}
The system must be compatible with different operating system such as Android, iOS for mobile
devices and Windows, Linux and Mac for the desktop.

\section{Formal Analysis Using Alloy}

This section is dedicated to the static modeling of the CKB platform, performed using the \texttt{Alloy} language (\href{https://alloytools.org/}{alloytools.org}). The goal of this analysis is to show the relations between the most important components of the CKB platform. In particular, the focus on the analysis is to represent a "snapshot" of the system in which are present two \texttt{Tournaments}, some \texttt{Battles}, and the corresponding \texttt{Students} participating to the battles. The "snapshot" is taken after the battles are concluded (and hence their score is assigned to the students).
\\
In the following, a list of the most important properties is provided.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \texttt{Battle} is associated to exactly one \texttt{Tournament}.
    \item Only \texttt{Students} subscribed to a \texttt{Tournament} can participate to \texttt{Battles}.
    \item A \texttt{Team} is formed in the context of a specific \texttt{Battle} and must comply to the battle criteria w.r.t. the number of participants.
    \item A \texttt{Student} cannot participate to the same battle with multiple \texttt{Teams}
    \item The tournament score for each \texttt{Student} (contained in the \texttt{StudentStats} entity) must be equal to the sum of the scores obtained by the \texttt{Student} in the battles in which he participated 
\end{enumerate}
The Alloy code is included below, and in Figure \ref{fig:AlloyWorld} a graphical representation of the Alloy World is provided.

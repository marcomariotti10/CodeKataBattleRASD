# CodeKataBattle ‚Äì Software Specification and Design

This repository documents the **requirements**, **architectural design**, **formal models**, and **UML artifacts** of a fictional educational platform called **CodeKataBattle** (CKB). It is the outcome of a Software Engineering 2 project and includes:

- RASD (Requirements Analysis and Specification Document)
- DD (Design Document)
- UML diagrams
- Alloy formal specification

‚ö†Ô∏è **This project does not implement CodeKataBattle ‚Äî it only describes it.**

## üìñ Project Summary

**CodeKataBattle (CKB)** is a fictional web platform designed to help students improve their programming skills through collaborative, test-driven exercises called *Code Katas*. Educators can create tournaments and coding battles, which students join in teams. The system integrates GitHub repositories and provides real-time scoring, feedback, and gamification through badges.

CKB is imagined as a modern, competitive alternative to traditional CS education.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `RASD.pdf` | *Requirements Analysis and Specification Document* ‚Äî defines goals, use cases, functional & non-functional requirements, and Alloy specification. |
| `DD.pdf` | *Design Document* ‚Äî describes system architecture, components, interfaces, deployment and runtime views, UI mockups, and implementation plan. |
| `uml_class_diagram.png` | UML Class Diagram for the entire CodeKataBattle system. Defines key entities like User, Tournament, Battle, Team, EvaluationSystem, Badge, etc. |
| `ckb_alloy_model.als` | Alloy model capturing the static constraints of the system (e.g. one team per battle, valid student-team memberships, badge assignment logic, etc.). |
